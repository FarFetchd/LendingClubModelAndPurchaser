How to rebuild the random forest model with the newest Lending Club data:
========================================
DOWNLOAD AND CLEAN:
========================================

1) download all of the history files from LC: LoanStats3a_securev1.csv through
   LoanStats3d_securev1.csv (or however far it goes). (See the datadownload/
   directory for how to do this (mostly) directly from destiny).

2) put them all (unzipped) in this top level directory.

3) run ./clean_LC_historical.sh. (This step will delete the input .csvs. If you
   still have the .zips around, it's safe to delete those yourself).

4) open an R terminal, and source("import_LC_historical.R"). Your nice, cleaned,
   usable historical data is now in cleaned_historical.csv.
   (After this step, you can delete combined.csv).

========================================
REBUILD MODEL:
========================================

1) in modelBuildingVars.R, set rfOutputFilename to desired file name to
   receive the to-be-used model. Set FIVE_ and THREE_YEARS_AGO appropriately.

1.5) if you would like to try different features/hyperparams, have multiple
     source("do_one_xgb_crossval.r") stanzas in crossvalRFmaster.R. Also, you
     can easily compare againt previous runs by plugging _pareto.csv filenames
     into compare_filenames. (Old+new must total no more than 6).

2) [This step can take a while - run it from within screen, just in case].
   From an R terminal in this top level dir: source("crossvalRFmaster.R")

3) **rfOutputFilename"_pareto.csv" will contain good int+badProb cutoffs for
     this model, and their historical ROIs. (_all.csv includes the bad ones).
   **rfOutputFilename"_record.pdf" is a plot of historical ROIs for badProb
     and interest buckets.
   **_writeoffs.pdf is _record.pdf with income subtracted off (lossess only).
   **_useful_heatmap.pdf is a *thresholded*, not bucketed, heatmap. That is,
     the cell at like interest 0.1, probBad 0.06, is what you would see for that
     entry in _all.csv or _pareto.csv.
   **********BUT BEST OF ALL! (at least while investigating features/params).
             Is the output of compare_scatterplots.r, whose filename is
             determined by compare_scatter_output_pdf.

3.5)    After making your picks, copy these into recordkeeping/, and make a
        _SUMMARY_***.txt file in recordkeeping/ describing your model.

4) Browse the _pareto.csv of your chosen model (or better yet the
   compare_scatterplots.r output pdf), to get a feel for the
   badProb+interest cutoffs, and ROIs and fractakens. However, you're no longer
   actually manually picking these badProb/interest cutoffs: set_spend_params.r
   will pick on-the-fly for you. (See step 6).

5) Run buildRealRFmodel.R, after adjusting (if applicable) RF features/params.

6) Finally, !!!COPY THE _pareto.csv OF YOUR CHOSEN MODEL'S CROSSVAL into
   purchaser/state/curPareto.csv  !!!
   BE SURE TO DO THIS! (buildRealRFmodel.R should also remind you).

========================================
DEPLOY
========================================

1) in loan_predictor.r, change the argument to rf<-rememberForest("...") to be
   the purchaser/ filepath that buildRealRFmodel.R wrote the model into.

2) Copy cur_badness_by_zip.csv and cur_purp_spec_badness.csv to
   purchaser/badness_by_zip.csv and purchaser/purp_spec_badness.csv.

3) in predictor_functions.r, update the hardcoded default badness_by_zip value.

4) ....that should be it. Don't even need to restart the C++ program.
   (However, you do need to restart if you want a new portfolio id. Make the
    portfolio on LC.com, get its ID from URL,
    put that ID in purchaser/source/account_info.d, recompile with `dub build`
******Running looks like******
./rest_loans_cpp --startnow=false --spendcap=2600 2>>logs/somefile
(well, actually just use the RUNLOANS.sh scripts)
******************************
   THEN, in monitor/calculate_lc_performance.r, just add the new portfolio name
   to the list. Safe to leave plot_gain.r alone. You need to make additions in
   there to see charts of the new portfolio, but nothing will break if you don't
   add them.

NOTE ON LOGS: if you move to a new log file, you need to go into
monitor/pull_lc_performance.sh, add a new "grep available" line with the new
"cur_" log name, and remove the "cur_" from the previous "grep available" line.
(Also move that old cur_ file in purchaser/logs!)

NOTE ON MONITOR: the _PERFORMANCE.csv and _CHARGEOFFS.csv of the new portfolio
both need the column names manually written in at the top.
