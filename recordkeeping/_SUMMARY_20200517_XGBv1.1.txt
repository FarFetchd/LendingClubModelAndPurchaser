NOTES:
* badness_by_zip is now sanitized of low-sample ZIPs; ones that would be 0 or 1
  are instead replaced with median or max.
* Did a single 10fold CV run.
* Otherwise identical to Sep2019 XGBv1 notes.
* Reminder, since I forgot and had to re-figure-out: looks like the ROIs
  here and in all older ones do NOT include the ~1% LC fee.


Features used:
===========================
Identical to Sep2019 XGBv1:
"MTHS_SINCE_LAST_MAJOR_DEROG","delinq_2yrs","badness_by_zip","jobtitlegood", "EMPLOYMENT_LENGTH",
"REVOLVING_UTILIZATION","INQUIRIES_IN_LAST_6_MONTHS", "after_loan_monthly_income","dti_frac",
"FICO_RANGE_LOW", "purp_spec_badness","LOAN_AMOUNT", "is_rent"

params (Identical to Sep2019 XGBv1): maxdepth = 11, numrounds = 200, eta = 0.1, minchildweight = 10

probBad cutoffs and interest threshs still dynamically chosen.



For an idea of performance, see
recordkeeping/cleaned-bbZIP_vs_without_vs_sep2019.pdf: The 3 10-fold CV runs
from Sep2019 vs the one with identical XGBv1 model from May2020 vs the XGBv1.1
model with bbZ sanitized.
Basically, with updated data, probably slightly better overall, but significantly
better for higher fractakens.
